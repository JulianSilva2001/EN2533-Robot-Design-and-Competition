## ðŸš€ Highlights:
- **Path Navigation and Obstacle Evasion:** The robot adeptly maneuvers through predefined paths, accurately handling black and white tracks using eight IR sensors and avoiding obstacles with the help of two ultrasonic sensors.
- **Ramp Climbing & Object Handling:** Demonstrates its proficiency in ascending ramps and relocating lightweight objects with precision.
- **Sound Recognition:** Equipped with a microphone, the robot halts movement in response to auditory signals.

## Robot Overview:
Our robot features an extensive array of sensors and control interfaces, designed to handle a variety of challenges seamlessly.

### Sensor Suite
- **TCS34725 RGB Color Sensor:** For detecting colored objects.
- **Uxel Sound Detection Module:** Uses a microphone for sound-triggered responses.
- **4 IR Sensors:** Utilized to accurately detect 90-degree turns.
- **Gyroscope:** Adjusts speed for efficient ramp climbing.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Employed for obstacle avoidance.
- **MAX9814 Microphone Amplifier Module:** Detects sound for auditory response tasks.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor:** Used specifically for the guard robot functionality.

### Actuation Mechanisms
- **Continuous Rotation SG90 Servo Motor Plastic Wheel Full Set (360 degrees):** This popular 9g servo motor is ideal for gripping mechanisms due to its ability to rotate continuously in 360 degrees.
- **Servo Motor Plastic Wheel MG995 Full Set (180 degrees):** This high-speed standard servo motor, capable of rotating approximately 180 degrees, is used for lifting applications and vertical movements.

### Power Supply
- **3300mAh LiPo Battery**

### Additional Hardware
- **N20 Standard 15mm High Universal Wheel**
- **MD0085 - L298N Motor Driver Module for Arduino (Normal)**
- **6V Buck Down Converter**
- **Battery Status Indicator**

### Robotic Arm CAD Design
The arm includes a gripper, distance sensor, and color sensor, all controlled by two servo motors. The gripper operates via a small servo motor (SG90), providing horizontal movement, while a larger servo motor (MG995) manages vertical movement. Sensors on the gripper enhance the arm's capabilities.
